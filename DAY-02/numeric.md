## Numeric Data Types in Python: A Compact Guide
Python provides three core numeric data types for representing different kinds of numbers:

int (Integer): Whole numbers (positive, negative, or zero). No inherent size limitations in Python 3.
float (Floating-Point Number): Real numbers with decimal points. Precision varies based on system architecture.
complex (Complex Number): Represents mathematical complex numbers with real and imaginary parts (supports operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).
Key Points:

Use type() to check a variable's data type.
Built-in functions (int(), float(), complex()) can convert between compatible numeric types (conversion errors might occur).
Standard arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, etc.) perform calculations.
Mathematical functions (e.g., pow(), sqrt()) are available in the math module.
Choosing the Right Type:

Use int for whole numbers where decimal precision isn't critical.
Use float for calculations involving decimals.
Use complex for mathematical concepts requiring both real and imaginary parts.
Understanding these data types and operations is essential for numerical computations in Python.
