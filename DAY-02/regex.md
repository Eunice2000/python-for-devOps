## Regular Expressions (Regex) in Python: A Compact Overview
Regex (regular expressions) empower Python with pattern matching capabilities. They offer a concise and adaptable approach to:

Searching: Locate specific patterns within text strings.
Extracting: Grab targeted information from text (e.g., dates, names).
Replacing: Find and substitute patterns within text.
Validating: Verify if text adheres to a defined format (e.g., email addresses).
Building Blocks:

Characters: Literal characters match themselves (e.g., "a" matches the letter "a").
Metacharacters: Special characters with specific meanings within a regex (e.g., "." matches any single character except newline).
Quantifiers: Specify how many times a preceding element can be matched (e.g., "*" for zero or more repetitions).
Groups: Capture and potentially reuse portions of the matched text.
Using Regex:

## Python's re module provides functions for regex operations:

re.search(): Finds the first occurrence of a pattern.
re.match(): Similar to search, but only matches if the pattern starts at the beginning.
re.findall(): Returns a list of all non-overlapping matches.
re.sub(): Replaces all occurrences of a pattern with a replacement string.
Benefits:

Conciseness: Express complex patterns compactly.
Flexibility: Match a wide variety of text patterns.
Power: Automate many text processing tasks.
Cautions:

Complexity: Regex can be challenging to learn and write effectively.
Overuse: Unnecessary regex use can make code harder to understand.
By understanding regex fundamentals, you can significantly enhance your text manipulation capabilities in Python.
